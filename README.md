# Ranking-Feature-importance
A simple project to rank the importance of sensors from the file, task_data.csv, containing hypothetically generated data. The set consists of 400 samples where for
each sample there are 10 different sensor readings available. The samples have been divided into two
classes where the class label is either 1 or -1. The class labels define to what particular class a particular
sample belongs. The project ranks the sensors according to their importance/predictive power with
respect to the class labels of the samples.
